**Cloud-based IoT System**

This repository contains the code for a cloud-based IoT system that collects data from virtual sensors using the MQTT protocol. The system displays the latest sensor data values and data from the last five hours for a specified sensor.

**Getting Started**

To run the virtual sensors and the cloud-based backend, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Set up the virtual sensors using the provided code.
Deploy the cloud-based backend using AWS IoT or ThingSpeak.
Configure the virtual sensors to publish data to the cloud-based backend.

**Usage**

Once the system is set up, you can access the latest sensor data values and historical data through the cloud-based backend's interface.

**Screenshots**

Include screenshots of the system's interface displaying the latest sensor data values and historical data.

**Technologies Used**

MQTT protocol
AWS IoT or ThingSpeak for the cloud-based backend
